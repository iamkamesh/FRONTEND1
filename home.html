    <p><bold>Yamaha</bold>Hatsud≈çki Kabushiki gaisha) is a Japanese mobility manufacturer that produces motorcycles, motorboats, outboard motors, and other motorized products. The company was established in 1955 upon separation from Yamaha Corporation (however, Yamaha Corporation is still the largest private company shareholder with 9.92%, as of 2019),[1] and is headquartered in Iwata, Shizuoka, Japan. The company conducts development, production and marketing operations through 109 consolidated subsidiaries as of 2012.[2][3]

        Led by Genichi Kawakami, the company's founder and first president, Yamaha Motor spun off from musical instrument manufacturer Yamaha Corporation in 1955 and began production of its first product, the YA-1 125cc motorcycle. It was quickly successful and won the 3rd Mount Fuji Ascent Race in its class.</p>
    <p>At the initial stage, Yamaha Japan was exporting all bikes from Japan to India. After 1990, Escorts started production in India, with some parts being imported from Japan</p>

    <h2>Successors</h2>
    <p>The Yamaha RX 100 production run lasted from November 1985 to March 1996. The model was followed by the 132 cc RX G. The RX G had an economy-minded engine configuration with the ports tuned to increase fuel-efficiency and decrease exhaust gas. This model was the reply to the stricter emissions controls, which were to continue affecting Yamaha's designs. The Japanese manufacturers responded in late 1997 with the Yamaha RX-135 and the RX-Z which had a tachometer and a sportier headlamp and body. Both were mechanically the same and the RX-135 received a lukewarm response.</p>
