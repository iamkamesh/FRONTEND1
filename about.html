    <h1>Yamaha Rx100 Growing Fast Momentz ðŸ›µ</h1>
    <p>Yamaha from 1985 to 1996 with technical collaboration and distributed in India by the Escorts Group.</p>

     <div class="col-sm-6 bg-dark text-white p-4">The RX100 designation was originally used in certain markets for the five-speed, short-stroke 97cc Yamaha RS100DX produced from 1977. This was an RS100 (itself a 1976 improvement upon the design of the original reed-valved 96cc RS100 that was introduced to the United Kingdom in September, 1974, and to the USA in November, 1974)[1][2] with a front disc brake and a tachometer, and was replaced in 1983 with the square-stroke, 98cc RX-S (with part numbers coded 31J),[3] a major update on the RS design (with substantial changes particularly to the cylinder, head, and induction, and the points ignition replaced by Yamaha Capacitor Discharge Ignition) which was to form the basis of the Escort-distributed variants including the EY-100 Escort Yamaha 100. The RXG had a primary and secondary reduction. It had the same lightened flywheel from the RX 100 which caused unpleasantly abrupt acceleration</div>
     <div class="col-sm-6 bg-primary text-white p-4">In India in November 1985, Yamaha released the RX 100 (a variant of the RX-S, not the original RX100 or RS100DX) to widespread acclaim. The appeal came largely from the high output of its 100 cc (6.1 cu in) engine. With its lightweight body and high power output, the resulting power to weight ratio of the bike made it the best 100 cc bike ever built for mass production, and as a result there is still a high demand for it many years after it ceased production.

        The RX 100 was quickly adopted by racers who recognized its potential for drag racing. Various modifications such as expansion chambers, head porting, engine tuning, sprocket changes and wheel size changes became fairly common. A large number of customization options include larger carburetors, air filters, quicker throttle, disc brakes, an additional 5th gear, race pistons, racing CDI systems, upgraded tires and suspension damping </div>
